I could see the issue more fast than comparing it manually on the screen.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It saves time, it shows the different changes over time, easier to find the issue

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
+i try to only make a commit when i do a logic change 
+i can keep track easily of my changes 
+i only commit logical changes thus only compilable versions
-chance of making too short or too big changes based on commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
the reason is to keep a curren status of all files together, 
it has to run together (i mean it has to be compiled)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log: to view what commits have been done in the git repository and identifying the differnent git ids
git diff: in combination with git log to validate the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
+ i know that i can revert the change anytime
+ no harm possible
